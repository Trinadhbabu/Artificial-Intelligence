problem statement:
    Here are the test scores of 10 students in physics and history:

Physics Scores  15  12  8   8   7   7   7   6   5   3
History Scores  10  25  17  11  13  17  20  13  9   15
Compute Karl Pearsonâ€™s coefficient of correlation between these scores.
Compute the answer correct to three decimal places.

Output Format

In the text box, using the language of your choice, print the floating point/decimal value required. Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.

For example, if your answer is 0.255. In python you can print using

print("0.255")

'''
x = [15,12,8,8,7,7,7,6,5,3]
y = [10,25,17,11,13,17,20,13,9,15]

def avge(a):
    return sum(a)/len(a)
    
def slope(x,y):
    x_dash = avge(x)
    y_dash = avge(y)
    numerator = sum([(yi-y_dash) * (xi-x_dash) for xi,yi in zip(x,y) ])
    denominator = sum([(xi-x_dash)**2 for xi in x]) * sum([(yi-y_dash)**2 for yi in y])
    return numerator/(denominator **0.5)



h = round(slope(x,y),3)
print(h)
